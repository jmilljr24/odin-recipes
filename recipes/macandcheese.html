    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make the best homemade mac and cheese of your life:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Macaroni</strong>: This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box of uncooked macaroni noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>flour</strong>: You'll need butter and flour to make a roux for the cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons of butter for the topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika is sprinkled over the topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs</strong>: Use store-bought dried bread crumbs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
